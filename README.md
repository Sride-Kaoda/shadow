This is a script in development that gives you access multiple lag based abilities in a webgl game that uses websocket.
This is dependent on Proxifier to work
There are currently 3 abilities in progress:
Time Skip that slightly delays your outbound packets slowly releasing them later to create an afterimage to the server and you have the ability to resume to regular with a toggle giving the appearance of skipping ahead of time like king crimson.
Aurion State: Heavily delaying your inbound packets so that you can ignore incoming objects and attacks similarly to kamui from naruto.
Shadow Realm: Heavily delaying or Limiting outbound packets so that you are seen as imobile while taking actions despite you seeing everything in real time, this can be toggled to give the effect of teleportation.
